Encapsulation
    - is a mechanism of wrapping the attributes and code acting on the methods together as a single unit
    - in encapsulation, the attributes of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as 'data hiding'.

Benefits:
    1. Simplified complexity
    2. Protect data

Access modifiers
    - are used to restrit access to the attributes and methods of class

    -- Three commonly used access modifiers are:
        - Public (+)
            - public attributes and methods are accessible from anywhere, both within the class and from outside the class
        - Protected(#)
            - protected attributes and methods are intended to be used within the class and its subclasses. They can be assessed from outside the class, but it is considered a convention to treat them as non-public and accessed only by convention.
        - Private (_)
            - private attributes and methods are meant to be accessed only within the class. They are accessible from outside the class, including the class
